# House Price Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors. The model leverages machine learning techniques to provide accurate price estimations, which can be useful for real estate valuation and investment decisions.

## Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering and Selection
- Machine Learning Model Training
- Model Evaluation and Optimization

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains information on houses, including features such as:
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Square footage
- Location
- Year built
- Additional amenities

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and identifying key features.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Selecting and creating meaningful features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Training:** Implementing machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
5. **Evaluation:** Using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R^2 to assess model performance.

## Requirements
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/house-price-model.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd house-price-model
```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Results
The final model provides an estimated house price based on input features, achieving an optimized performance through hyperparameter tuning.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional data sources to enhance predictions
- Experiment with deep learning models
- Deploy the model as a web application
